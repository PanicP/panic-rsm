## Reflection

This was a 1.5-week-long project built during the semester break at the Hochschule Fulda. Project goals included using only a few technologies and applying knowledge from work experience.

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to be able to interact (in some ways) with the web application but it takes too long. So, I decided to build a web application that uses only necessary libraries.

One of the main challenges I ran into was the Carousel component. This leads me to spend a few days on a research spike into how to make the Carousel component shareable and how to make CSS in this component work as I want. Due to project time constraints, I had to focus on functions that can be applied quickly and work as intended.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project mainly are React with Typescript, Styled-components, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `vite` boilerplate to minimize the initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. I also chose `react-spotify-embed` to display my favorite songs because I can't find a way to get Spotify APIs.
